Some ideas/things to try

1. Can we use Census 2021 to create density maps of population/social deprivation/ethnicities/access to transport etc and overlay them on the counter locations as used in Figure 1 in the article

2. Can we use land habitat data/green infrastructure data to create density maps of different land types and overlay them on the counter locations as shown above

3. Evaluating bias in Strava data/calibration against the ground truth data- re-creating Figs 2-4 as used in the article
